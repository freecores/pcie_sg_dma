ML605 is a directory for the PCIe DMA engine on ML605, ported from the Virtex5 project under trunk.

Simulation is similar to the Virtex5 project, so here no simulation is included.

If you want to do simulation, use the sg_sim.mpf under trunk\sim and replace the corresponding files with Virtex version files for work library.
